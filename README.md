## Laravel Simple Marketplace Package

ðŸš€ Welcome to the Laravel Simple Marketplace - where setting up an e-commerce solution is as easy as spotting the moon on a clear night! ðŸŒ”  
<br><br>

Before we launch, make sure you've got Laravel installed and you've run the migrations (because our package needs users like a spaceship needs astronauts!).

### Installation
Ready for a smooth takeoff? Just follow these steps:

1. Install Package via Composer:
    ```bash
    composer require danialhatami/simple-marketplace:dev-master
    ```
2. Initiate Installation:
    ```bash
    php artisan simple-marketplace:install
    ```
3. Migration Check
    Do a quick moonwalk over to your migrations. Modify them if you must (but let's try not to). Another round of migration will lay the groundwork for your marketplace.
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```
4. That's it

### Key Business Logic
- Product: Title, price, multiple images
- Product Search: By title, with price filters and low-price sorting
- Seller/User Product Management: Add/remove products, inventory control
- Order Process: Simple ordering, cost calculation, admin email alerts
- Delivery Options: Doorstep delivery

After installation, you can customize the admin email.
Navigate to the `config/marketplace.php` file and modify the admin_email value to suit your needs.
